Reference / learning guide for the Go programming language.

This repository is a compilation of my notes when learning the [Go programming language](https://golang.org/) and serves as my own personal reference guide. It follows the textbook *The Go Programming Language* by Alan Donovan and Brian Kernighan. There are many instances where I directly copy their wording or examples, but majority of the wording and examples have been at least slightly altered to follow my own understanding.

Since a fair share of this material is ripped from the textbook, I yield no claims of originality for this material. If you want to properly learn the language, I would recommend reading the source textbook itself as it is very well written.
